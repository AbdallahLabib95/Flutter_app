# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/
    - images/hotel/
    - images/fitness_app/
    - images/design_course/
    - images/animal_world/
    - images/car_rental/
    - images/e_commerce/
    - assets/
    - assets/img/
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: customFont
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/DaysOne-Regular.ttf
          weight: 700
          style: italic
    - family: WorkSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
